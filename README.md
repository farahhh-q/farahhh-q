- 👋 Hi, I’m tadashi(code-name hehe)!!
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev, 3d modelling and printing, and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c! and am planning on learning GameMaker once i get free time
- 💞️ Although i have been at uni for 2 years, I still feel like beginner in coding, so i would love to get some experience in easy collaborative projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: im a 2nd year software engineering student at unimelb. I love coding, but I don't get a lot of free time to code for fun. I want to start working on personal coding projects, both for fun and to boost my chances of landing an internship!
